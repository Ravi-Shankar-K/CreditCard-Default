# Credit Card Default Prediction with Machine Learning

## Overview
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict credit card defaults 
based on the "Default Payments of Credit Card Clients in Taiwan from 2005" dataset. 
The data covers a span of 6 months from April to September and includes information 
about credit card usage, payments, and customer demographics in Taiwan.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to build predictive models that effectively 
identify potential credit card defaults. Models will be trained and evaluated using 
historical data from April to September to forecast defaults accurately.

## Dataset
The "Default Payments of Credit Card Clients in Taiwan from 2005" dataset comprises the following features:

**Customer Information:** Demographic data, credit limit, education level.  
**Payment History:** Previous payment amounts, bill statements, payment status.

## Methodology
**Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, handling missing values, feature engineering, sampling techniques and encoding categorical variables.  
**Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understanding data distributions, correlations, and patterns.  
**Feature Selection**: Identifying relevant features for modeling.  
**Model Building**: Employing various machine learning algorithms for prediction.  
**Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics.  

## Requirements
Python 3.x  
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib, etc.
## Conclusion
➡️ This README provides a detailed overview of the project structure, objectives, 
dataset details, and methodology used for predicting credit card defaults based on the provided dataset.
